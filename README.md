# InfoSec Starter Kit
I frequently get asked to provide some materials to get someone started who wants to break into Information Security.  Now I can just point them to here!  =)

## Getting Started
1. Set up an account on an RSS reader of your choice (I suggest [feedly](https://feedly.com/)).
  1. Download and import [feeds.opml](./feeds.opml) and read all the articles.
1. Setup a podcast app ([iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/), [Pocket Casts](https://play.pocketcasts.com/), etc.).
  1. Download and import [podcasts.opml](./podcasts.opml).  Set them all to automatically download (I suggest restricting this to only while on WiFi).

## Protips
* Read.  A lot.  Look up up anything you don't understand while you're reading.
* Make good use of your downtime.  Listen to podcasts or audiobooks while you're driving, exercising, doing yard work, etc.

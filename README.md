# InfoSec Starter Kit
Here are some materials for someone who wants to break into Information Security.

## Getting Started
1. Set up an account on an RSS reader of your choice (I suggest [feedly](https://feedly.com/)).
  1. Download and import [feeds.opml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonzeolla/infosec-starter-kit/master/feeds.opml) and read all the articles.
1. Setup a podcast app ([iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/), [Pocket Casts](https://play.pocketcasts.com/), etc.).
  1. Download and import [podcasts.opml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonzeolla/infosec-starter-kit/master/podcasts.opml).  Set them all to automatically download (I suggest restricting this to only while on WiFi).
1.  Read through some of [these articles](https://gist.github.com/mubix/5737a066c8845d25721ec4bf3139fd31).

## Protips
* Make your time as efficient as possible.  Listen to podcasts or audiobooks while you're driving, exercising, doing yard work, etc.
* Find things that interest you and play around with them.  Ask a lot of questions, be curious.  Continue to dig into a topic until you feel you could easily teach it to somebody else from scratch.
